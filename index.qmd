UK Conference On Teaching Statistics (UKCOTS) is for everyone with an interest in the teaching of statistics in higher education in whatever department or discipline. UKCOTS is supported by the Royal Statistical Society (RSS).

While the primary intended audience is statistics educators working in higher education, the conference is open to all, including those interested in pre-18 statistics education, or in professional training.

With the second UKCOTS held at University of Glasgow now completed following the success of the first UKCOTS at the University of Manchester, we will be planning to host the next UKCOTS in 2027. Watch this space for updates!
