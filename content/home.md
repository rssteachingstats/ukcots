### Social events

Two social events are planned:

-  Pre-conference social on Wednesday 12 June, from 19:00, at Kro Bar, 325 Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PG (5-minute walk from the Alan Turing Building). You will be able to purchase drinks and food, and we will be running an informal pub quiz for those who would like to take part. The venue will have a space reserved for UKCOTS delegates.
- Not-conference-dinner on Thursday 13 June, from 19:00, at Mackie Mayor, Eagle Street, Manchester, M4 5BU. This is a food court in an 1858 Grade II listed market building. Please feel free to buy your own drinks/food at the venue. We will have a reserved space.
	- Note that Mackie Mayor is on the northern edge of the city centre, about a 35-minute walk from the Alan Turing Building
	- We expect that most delegates who are going to Mackie Mayor will want to do so directly from their accommodation
	- For anyone wishing to travel directly from the University of Manchester campus to Mackie Mayor, a group of us will be meeting outside the Alan Turing Building at 18:15
	- There is an option to take a bus from Oxford Road: the 18 or 41 will take you to near Oak Street/High Street and from there it’s a 3-minute walk
	- Another option is to share an Uber/black cab: that would be in the region of £8 - £12 and take around 15 minutes.
