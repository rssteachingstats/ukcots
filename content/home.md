# UKCOTS 2024: *Teaching Statistics in HE, across all disciplines*

The [RSS Teaching Statistics Section](https://rss.org.uk/membership/rss-groups-and-committees/sections/teaching-statistics/) are delighted to announce that the first *UK Conference on Teaching Statistics* (UKCOTS) will be held at the University of Manchester, 13-14 June, 2024.
The 2024 UKCOTS conference will also host the Annual Conference for Teachers of Statistics in Medicine and Allied Health Sciences (known as 'Burwalls'). 

UKCOTS is for everyone with an interest in the teaching of statistics in higher education in whatever department or discipline. While the primary intended audience is statistics educators working in higher education, the conference is open to all, including those interested in pre-18 statistics education, or in professional training. 

We are looking forward to hearing the best ideas and approaches from across the academic spectrum, so do put the dates in your diary.

## Conference venue 

The conference will be held in the Alan Turing building (Upper Brook Street, Manchester, M13 9SR; [interactive map](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/maps/interactive-map/?id=44)), about a mile from the city centre and the major stations.  

## Accomodation and dining in Manchester 

On the dates of the conference, the University of Manchester's university accommodation is not available for use by conference attendees.  However, Manchester is packed out with hotels at a range of prices, and there are plenty of hotel booking sites (plus Premier Inns!) from which you can choose one that suits you.

The conference fee includes coffee/tea/etc plus lunch.  We are not planning a formal conference dinner.  However, we are planning to reserve an area in the city centre for the Thursday evening where delegates can buy a meal from a range of delicious eateries and then sit together.  The previous evening we will nominate a pub where those who have arrived early can gather to drink, eat and make data.  When you register, you will be asked to indicate whether you are interested in either of these events so that we can gauge rough numbers.  We will firm up details closer to the conference.
