# UKCOTS: _Teaching Statistics in HE, across all disciplines_

The first _UK Conference on Teaching Statistics_ (UKCOTS) was organized by the [RSS Teaching Statistics Section](https://rss.org.uk/membership/rss-groups-and-committees/sections/teaching-statistics/) and held at the University of Manchester on the 13th and 14th of June, 2024.
The 2024 UKCOTS conference also hosted the _Annual Conference for Teachers of Statistics in Medicine and Allied Health Sciences_ (known as [_Burwalls_](https://sites.google.com/view/burwalls/home)).

UKCOTS is for everyone with an interest in the teaching of statistics in higher education in whatever department or discipline.
While the primary intended audience is statistics educators working in higher education, the conference is open to all, including those interested in pre-18 statistics education, or in professional training.

To mark the first UKCOTS, there will be a special edition of the journal [Teaching Statistics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14679639).
