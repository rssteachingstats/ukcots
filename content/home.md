# UKCOTS 2024

The [RSS Teaching Statistics Section](https://rss.org.uk/membership/rss-groups-and-committees/sections/teaching-statistics/) are delighted to announce that the first *UK Conference on Teaching Statistics* (UKCOTS) will be held at the University of Manchester, 13-14 June, 2024.
The 2024 UKCOTS conference will also host the Annual Conference for Teachers of Statistics in Medicine and Allied Health Sciences (known as 'Burwalls'). 

UKCOTS is for everyone with an interest in the teaching of statistics in higher eduction in whatever department of discipline. While the primary intended audience is statistics educators working in higher education, the conference is open to all, including those interested in pre-18 statistics education, or in professional training. 

We are looking forward to hearing the best ideas and approaches from across the academic spectrum, so do put the dates in your diary.


### Call for abstracts is now open!

Proposals can be for individual contributions of 5 minutes (e.g. lightning talk) or 20 minutes (e.g. longer talk or activity), which will be delivered as part of sessions programmed by the organisers. Alternatively, you may wish to propose an entire 60-minute session yourself (e.g. an interactive workshop, a series of connected talks, or a panel discussion). There is also the option of a poster presentation. We encourage creativity in your proposals, and interactivity will be viewed favourably. The conference will be in person only; presenters will be expected to join us in Manchester for the conference.
