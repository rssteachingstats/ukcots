**Advice from Helen MacGillivray, Editor of Teaching Statistics**

Potential authors can write about an educational research project, actual
teaching in Higher Education, or anything else that's relevant.

Authors should make sure that they:

- fully describe teaching context;

- give relevant references and link with existing statistics education
  literature;

  - It may be useful to search for terms in the [Teaching Statistics
    journal](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14679639) and use
    those references;

  - Another excellent source are the [International Conference on
    Statistics Education (ICOTS)
    proceedings](http://iase-web.org/Conference_Proceedings.php).

- don't generalise or over-claim;

- avoid verbosity;

- analyse objectively -- that is, present what evidence there is and/or
  analyse with respect to good statistics;

  - don't be afraid of using graphical displays of data or other useful
    information;

  - there is no need to conduct statistical analysis unless there is clear
    need to do so.

- discuss the limitations of your work.

It is a good idea to look at prize-winning articles of in Teaching Statistics
to get a feel for style and how to pitch a Teaching Statistics paper. However,
the nature of a paper will depend on your topic, so don't be put off by if
these don't resonate with you.
