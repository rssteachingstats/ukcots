**Teaching statistics UKCOTS special issue**

We are delighted to announce that a [Teaching Statistics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14679639){target="_blank"} special edition for UKCOTS24 will be published in 2025. More information to follow!

**Advice from Helen MacGillivray, Editor of Teaching Statistics on educational research writing**

Potential authors can write about an educational research project, actual teaching in Higher Education, or anything else that's relevant. Authors should make sure that they:

-   Fully describe teaching context;

-   Give relevant references and link with existing statistics education literature;

    -   It may be useful to search for terms in the [Teaching Statistics journal](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14679639){target="_blank"} and use those references;

    -   Another excellent source are the [International Conference on Statistics Education (ICOTS) proceedings](http://iase-web.org/Conference_Proceedings.php).

-   Don't generalise or over-claim;

-   Avoid verbosity;

-   Analyse objectively -- that is, present what evidence there is and/or analyse with respect to good statistics;

    -   Don't be afraid of using graphical displays of data or other useful information;

    -   There is no need to conduct statistical analysis unless there is clear need to do so.

-   Discuss the limitations of your work.

It is a good idea to look at prize-winning articles of in Teaching Statistics to get a feel for style and how to pitch a Teaching Statistics paper. However, the nature of a paper will depend on your topic, so don't be put off by if these don't resonate with you.

**General resources on pedagogic research**

In response to Thursday afternoon's panel on research in teaching statistics in Higher Education at UKCOTS24, you may find the advice on getting started in statistics education research on the [Consortium for the Advancement of Undergraduate Statistics Education (CAUSE) website](https://causeweb.org/cause/){target="_blank"} helpful.
