More information to follow!\nAdvice from Helen MacGillivray, Editor of Teaching Statistics on educational research writing\nPotential authors can write about an educational research project, actual teaching in Higher Education, or anything else that’s relevant. Authors should make sure that they:\n\nFully describe teaching context;\nGive relevant references and link with existing statistics education literature;\n\nIt may be useful to search for terms in the Teaching Statistics journal and use those references;\nAnother excellent source are the International Conference on Statistics Education (ICOTS) proceedings.\n\nDon’t generalise or over-claim;\nAvoid verbosity;\nAnalyse objectively – that is, present what evidence there is and/or analyse with respect to good statistics;\n\nDon’t be afraid of using graphical displays of data or other useful information;\nThere is no need to conduct statistical analysis unless there is clear need to do so.\n\nDiscuss the limitations of your work.\n\nIt is a good idea to look at prize-winning articles of in Teaching Statistics to get a feel for style and how to pitch a Teaching Statistics paper. However, the nature of a paper will depend on your topic, so don’t be put off by if these don’t resonate with you.\nGeneral resources on pedagogic research\nIn response to Thursday afternoon’s panel on research in teaching statistics in Higher Education at UKCOTS24, you may find the advice on getting started in statistics education research on the Consortium for the Advancement of Undergraduate Statistics Education (CAUSE) website helpful.\nNeed more information?\nPlease contact Elinor Jones (elinor.jones@ucl.ac.uk) for more information or further advice."
