    "text": "Teaching statistics UKCOTS special issue\nUKCOTS presenters, which includes presenters of workshops, short oral presentations, posters, and members of panels, are encouraged to submit a paper for the UKCOTS Teaching Statistics special edition.\n\nThe deadline for submission is 31 October 2024, with publication roughly mid-2025.\nGeneral author guidelines apply to special editions, though note the further information below.\nPapers should be submitted via ScholarOne Teaching Statistics (wiley.com)\n\nThere is no special link or portal to submit for the UKCOTS special edition; please use the standard Teaching Statistics submission portal.\nDuring the submission process, there will be a box to tick to indicate that your work is for a special edition. Please ensure you tick the box!\n\nYou will be supported! Reviewers will give you constructive feedback to improve your work; they are not there to tear it apart.\n\nAdvice from Helen MacGillivray, Editor of Teaching Statistics\nPotential authors can write about an educational research project, actual teaching in Higher Education, or anything else that’s relevant. Authors should make sure that they:\n\nFully describe teaching context;\nGive relevant references and link with existing statistics education literature;\n\nIt may be useful to search for terms in the Teaching Statistics journal and use those references;\nAnother excellent source are the International Conference on Statistics Education (ICOTS) proceedings.\n\nDon’t generalise or over-claim;\nAvoid verbosity;\nAnalyse objectively – that is, present what evidence there is and/or analyse with respect to good statistics;\n\nDon’t be afraid of using graphical displays of data or other useful information;\nThere is no need to conduct statistical analysis unless there is clear need to do so.\n\nDiscuss the limitations of your work.\n\nIt is a good idea to look at prize-winning articles of in Teaching Statistics to get a feel for style and how to pitch a Teaching Statistics paper. However, the nature of a paper will depend on your topic, so don’t be put off by if these don’t resonate with you.\nGeneral resources on pedagogic research\nIn response to Thursday afternoon’s panel on research in teaching statistics in Higher Education, you may find the advice on getting started in statistics education research on the Consortium for the Advancement of Undergraduate Statistics Education (CAUSE) website helpful.\nNeed more information?\nPlease contact Elinor Jones (elinor.jones@ucl.ac.uk) for more information or further advice."
