<h1 id="ukcots-teaching-statistics-in-he-across-all-disciplines">UKCOTS:
<em>Teaching Statistics in HE, across all disciplines</em></h1>
<p>The first <em>UK Conference on Teaching Statistics</em> (UKCOTS) was
organized by the <a
href="https://rss.org.uk/membership/rss-groups-and-committees/sections/teaching-statistics/">RSS
Teaching Statistics Section</a> and held at the University of Manchester
on the 13th and 14th of June, 2024. The 2024 UKCOTS conference also
hosted the <em>Annual Conference for Teachers of Statistics in Medicine
and Allied Health Sciences</em> (known as <a
href="https://sites.google.com/view/burwalls/home"><em>Burwalls</em></a>).</p>
<p>UKCOTS is for everyone with an interest in the teaching of statistics
in higher education in whatever department or discipline. While the
primary intended audience is statistics educators working in higher
education, the conference is open to all, including those interested in
pre-18 statistics education, or in professional training.</p>
<h2
