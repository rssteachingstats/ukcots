<h3 id="getting-to-manchester">Getting to Manchester</h3>
<p>Manchester is well served by public transport. The closest train stations to the UKCOTS venue are Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Oxford Road.</p>
<h3 id="getting-to-the-ukcots-venue">Getting to the UKCOTS venue</h3>
<p>UKCOTS is being hosted by the University of Manchester and is taking place in the Alan Turing Building, Upper Brook Street, Manchester, M13 9PL ( <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/maps/interactive-map/?id=44">interactive map</a>). You can also access the building from Oxford Road, which runs parallel to Upper Brook Street. <a href="https://citymapper.com/manchester">Citymapper Manchester</a> provides an excellent real-time route mapper, wherever you land initially in Manchester.</p>
<p>To get to the venue from Manchester Piccadilly station, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walk: about 15-20 minutes</li>
<li>Take a bus: the 147 takes you from Piccadilly station (Stop D - use the Fairfield Street exit) to the University Shopping Centre stop on Oxford Road, which is then a 3-minute walk to the Alan Turing Building [note that the 147 bus only runs every 30 minutes]</li>
<li>Take a taxi: there is a taxi rank of black cabs at the Fairfield Street exit from the station (cost: likely to be less than £10)</li>
</ul>
<p>From Manchester Oxford Road station, you can:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="during-the-conference">During the conference</h3>
<p>The conference takes place on 13 and 14 June. All sessions and refreshments will be on the ground floor of the Alan Turing Building. The registration desk will be in the foyer of the building. If you have any questions or concerns, please head to the registration desk which will be staffed during the conference. Additionally, you will be able to identify members of the conference organising committee as this will be marked on their name badges. Specific instructions for presenters and session chairs have been sent out.</p>
<p>Please note that at the conference there will be no welcome packs, no printed abstract booklets and no printed timetables. To help keep costs to a minimum, and to manage our environmental impact, we ask delegates to access all conference materials online.</p>
<p>All supplied information on dietary requirements has been passed to the conference caterers. Please only take food provided for those with dietary requirements (vegan, gluten free etc.) if you have specifically requested it. Room G109 in the Alan Turing Building is a designated quiet room. Please reserve this room as a retreat for those wishing to escape noise, interaction and stimulation.</p>

<h3 id="social-events">Social events</h3>
<p>Two social events are planned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-conference social on Wednesday 12 June, from 19:00, at <a href="https://www.kro.co.uk/">Kro Bar</a>, 325 Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PG (5-minute walk from the Alan Turing Building). You will be able to purchase drinks and food, and we will be running an informal pub quiz for those who would like to take part. The venue will have a space reserved for UKCOTS delegates.</li>
<li>Not-conference-dinner on Thursday 13 June, from 19:00, at <a href="https://www.visitmanchester.com/listing/mackie-mayor/35719101/">Mackie Mayor</a>, Eagle Street, Manchester, M4 5BU. This is a food court in an 1858 Grade II listed market building. Please feel free to buy your own drinks/food at the venue. We will have a reserved space.
<ul>
<li>Note that Mackie Mayor is on the northern edge of the city centre, about a 35-minute walk from the Alan Turing Building</li>
<li>We expect that most delegates who are going to Mackie Mayor will want to do so directly from their accommodation</li>
<li>For anyone wishing to travel directly from the University of Manchester campus to Mackie Mayor, a group of us will be meeting outside the Alan Turing Building at 18:15</li>
<li>There is an option to take a bus from Oxford Road: the 18 or 41 will take you to near Oak Street/High Street and from there it’s a 3-minute walk</li>
<li>Another option is to share an Uber/black cab: that would be in the region of £8 - £12 and take around 15 minutes.</li>
</ul></li>
