2024: <em>Teaching Statistics in HE, across all disciplines</em></h1>
<p>The <a

Teaching Statistics Section</a> are delighted to announce that the first
<em>UK Conference on Teaching Statistics</em> (UKCOTS) will be held at
the University of Manchester, 13-14 June, 2024. The 2024 UKCOTS
conference will also host the Annual Conference for Teachers of
Statistics in Medicine and Allied Health Sciences (known as
‘Burwalls’).</p>
<p>UKCOTS is for everyone with an interest in the teaching of statistics
in higher education in whatever department or discipline. While the
primary intended audience is statistics educators working in higher
education, the conference is open to all, including those interested in
pre-18 statistics education, or in professional training.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to hearing the best ideas and approaches from
across the academic spectrum, so do put the dates in your diary.</p>

in Manchester</h2>
<p>On the dates of the conference, the University of Manchester’s
university accommodation is not available for use by conference
attendees. However, Manchester is packed out with hotels at a range of
prices, and there are plenty of hotel booking sites (plus Premier Inns!)
from which you can choose one that suits you.</p>
<p>The conference fee includes coffee/tea/etc plus lunch. We are not
planning a formal conference dinner. However, we are planning to reserve
an area in the city centre for the Thursday evening where delegates can
buy a meal from a range of delicious eateries and then sit together. The
previous evening we will nominate a pub where those who have arrived
early can gather to drink, eat and make data. When you register, you
will be asked to indicate whether you are interested in either of these
events so that we can gauge rough numbers. We will firm up details
closer to the conference.</p>
